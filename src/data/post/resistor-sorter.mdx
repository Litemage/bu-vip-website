# The Messy Drawers Problem
At Bradley University, there are a few electrical engineering labs that have 
large storage drawers containing different passive components used for experiments, 
one of which is through-hole resistors.

Because they are a core electrical component, we generally have lots of resistors 
on hand in many drawers. This can be hard to manage logistically when many 
students, some of whom have never seen these components before, need to remove 
and replace resistors correctly. The incorrect storage of these resistors has 
led to many headaches and frustrated trips back to storage to fetch a few 
resistors in the hope that one is of the correct value.

The Resistor Sorter machine is designed to sort resistors of different values 
into the correct storage drawers, thus solving the problem of manually trusting
puny humans to return resistors to the correct bin. 

# Project Design

The project is planned to take multiple semesters to complete due to complexity, 
but we accomplished our goal of getting the machine to move to different drawers, 
given the value of an incoming resistor, within two semesters. 

The Resistor Sorter is made from a number of different components. 
The most important of which are the stepper motors and the Arduino. The first 
stepper motor moves the gantry left and right, and the second moves the entire 
platform that the gantry is on up and down. The Arduino uses code and a pair of 
stepper motor drivers to drive the motors on the gantry and move the end-effector.

The code lets the gantry move to its starting position from startup, no matter
where it is, and from there move to any position that is input (within the
bounds of the cabinets). It can return to its starting position using a homing
program and a limit switch, inspired by many 3D printers. It can then take any
resistor value that’s input and move to the corresponding cabinet.

## Hardware

The resistor sorter machine needed to be strong, but still easy to change as
the design evolved. For these requirements, our team decided to use 20mm profile
aluminum extrusion for building the frame. All of the motors and supporting
hardware are attached to this extrusion.

As for the motors, the resistor sorter uses some NEMA 17 bipolar stepper motors
to move the gantry and effector around. These motors drive a variety of shafts
and belts directly for the X and Y axes. 

The end-effector uses a rack-and-pinion system to move the electromagnet closer
to the drawer to open it. The pinion is driven by a servo hidden inside the
end-effector.

## Electrical

The resistor sorter project uses stepper motors to control the gantry, similar
to most 3d printers, and a couple of servos to control the end effector. The
end-effector is responsible for opening and closing drawers with an
electromagnet and dropping resistors into the drawers. 

The whole system’s schematic looks  like this:

The electronics sport a 20A circuit breaker, an AC-DC power supply, an Arduino
Uno R3 microcontroller, two limit switches used for homing, and a pair of
stepper motors and drivers for the X and Y axes. 

The stepper drivers’ 12V supply can be interrupted by an E-Stop switch in case
the motors are doing something they shouldn’t be.

## Software

The resistor sorter machine's software suite primarily runs on a
microcontroller. Specifically, the team has implemented an Arduino Uno board
that controls the stepper motors and other electromechanical components needed
to manipulate the resistors. 

Manual input is currently needed to tell the gantry where to go, but eventually
the coordinates will be determined automatically from the detected resistance. 

The hardware control system is designed in such a way that it can receive
commands over its serial interface from other systems. This results in a modular
interface available to other projects, like a visual machine learning algorithm
for identifying the resistors by their color. 

# Conclusion

The students on our project have the opportunity to mix with many different
skill levels and learn something new every day. 

Our project will continue for the next couple of semesters as we gradually
implement the resistance detection system and other mechanical upgrades to
make the sorter fully functional.
